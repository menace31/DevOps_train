        Core Context: Start with a single sentence defining the specific scope of this fragment.

        Key Technical Data: Extract and list all architectures ,specific parameters, and methodologies.

        Critical Findings: Summarize results, observations (e.g., entropy trends), or limitations (e.g., redundancy, noise) mentioned.

        Constraints: Precision: Do NOT omit numerical data or specific technical names.

        Concision: Use bullet points. Avoid conversational filler like 'the document discusses' or 'the author says'.

        Self-Containment: Ensure the summary is understandable without needing the full original text"""
